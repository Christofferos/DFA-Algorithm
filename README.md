# DFA-Algorithm
An algorithm that generates all accepted strings of length up to 5000 symbols for a given Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The algorithm can handle directed graphs with over 500 nodes (vertices) and 5000 transitions (edges) and find several thousand words that are accepted by the automaton in under 1 second.
